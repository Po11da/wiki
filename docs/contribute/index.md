# Contributing to SteamFork

Your contribution helps SteamFork become a better Linux distribution, so we're glad you're here! We aim to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.  

Contributors are able to:

- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a fix
- Propose new features
- Become a maintainer

## Becoming a maintainer

When contributing to SteamFork you are expected to become the maintainer of your contribution.  Please keep this in mind when submitting pull requests.

- Keep track of your contributions upstream and keep your components up-to-date.
- Watch the issue tracker and resolve issues related to your contribution.

### We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Build and test an update and install image with your changes.
3. Any changes should be reflected in the documentation.
4. Issue a pull request back to our `main` branch.

### Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Please follow the same style as the source you are editing.
- If you are contributing new code, keep the style consistent with other similar works.
- Parameterize as much as possible, try to avoid hard coded values whenever you can.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs when possible.

### License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be contributed under the same license as the original project code.

## Getting Started

Our recommended next step is getting a build environment set up so you can see how SteamFork works and how packages are built.  Check out the details in [Building SteamFork](build.md).
