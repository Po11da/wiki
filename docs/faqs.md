## About SteamFork

### Does SteamFork offer any formal support?
No. SteamFork is something that we develop for fun, it is provided as-is.  We do provide a bug tracker, however as a community supported project there is no commitment of formal support.

### Do you support X device?  Will you add support for X device?
You can find the list of currently supported devices here: [Devices](../devices)

If the device you are interested in isn't in that list then no one has contributed the work to add support for it yet.  Why? To add support for a device we (1) need to be interested in adding support for it ðŸ˜Š and (2) need to have direct access to the device.

That said, anyone who is interested can submit updates to SteamFork to add support for a device they care about! If you are interested in adding support for a new device please start here: [Contribute](../contribute)

## Using SteamFork

### How do I log in over SSH or Samba?
* Log into desktop mode and enable it with command: `sudo systemctl start sshd`.
* To enable it on every boot (not recommended): `sudo steamos-readonly disable && sudo systemctl enable sshd`.
